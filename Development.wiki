#summary Describes how to develop MxUpdate

<wiki:toc max_depth="3"/>

----

= Introduction =
For the development of !MxUpdate [http://maven.apache.org Maven]Êis used. For
the specific configuration see the related developer description for
[Development_Update MxUpdate Update Tool] and the
[Development_Manual MxUpdate Manual].

----

= Maven Environment Specific Settings =
Depending on the environment some specific settings could be defined. For maven
the settings are located in the file {{{~/.m2/settings.xml}}} (home
directory of current user and then sub directory {{{.m2}}}).

== HTTP Proxy for Maven ==
Maven downloads via HTTP protocol required dependencies (e.g. the test-ng Java
libraries). In the case an HTTP proxy must be defined, the settings for
Maven must be changed.

Following snippet must be added to the setting file:
{{{
<settings>
    :
  <proxies>
    <proxy>
       <active>true</active>
       <protocol>http</protocol>
       <host>proxy.somewhere.com</host>
       <port>8080</port>
         :
     </proxy>
  </proxies>
    :
</settings>
}}}
For more information see also the
[http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html proxy guide] from Maven.
