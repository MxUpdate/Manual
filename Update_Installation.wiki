== Support of old MX versions ==

=== Relationship as from / to side for Relationships ===
If the used MX version within the project does not support the feature to use also relationships as from / to side the property "DMRelationSupportRelCons" must be changed and set to {{{false}}}. So following line must be added to the additional property file:
{{{
ParameterDef.DMRelationSupportRelCons.Default = false
}}}
The installed default value is {{{true}}}.

=== Role Types ===
If the used MX version within the project does not support the role type feature, property "!UserRoleSupportRoleType" must be changed and set to {{{false}}}. So following line must be added to the additional property file:
{{{
ParameterDef.UserRoleSupportRoleType.Default = false
}}}
The installed default value is {{{true}}}.
