Download the MxUpdate Update deployment tool.

Start MQL.


Define the MQL environment variable *{{{ENV_NAME_MXUPDATE_PATH}}}* to the path where the *{{{MxInstall.mql}}}* file is located.

If some additional properties must be defined, the MQL environment variable *{{{ENV_NAME_MAPPING_EXTENSION}}}* could be defined. The value is the path of the file which defines the additional properties.

Run MQL script *{{{MxInstall.mql}}}*.

== Support of old MX versions ==

=== Relationship as from / to side for Relationships ===
If the used MX version within the project does not support the feature to use also relationships as from / to side the property "DMRelationSupportRelCons" must be changed and set to {{{false}}}. So following line must be added to the additional property file:
{{{
ParameterDef.DMRelationSupportRelCons.Default = false
}}}
Automatically this value is set to {{{true}}}.
