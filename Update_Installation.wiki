= Installation =
[http://code.google.com/p/mxupdate/downloads/list Download] and uncompress the !MxUpdate Update deployment tool. E.g. the tool is unpacked into directory {{{C:\project\MxUpdate\}}}.

Start MQL.

Define the MQL environment variable *{{{MXUPDATE_PATH}}}* to the path where the *{{{MxInstall.mql}}}* file is located. E.g.
{{{
set env MXUPDATE_PATH C:\project\MxUpdate\
}}}
If some additional properties must be defined, the MQL environment variable *{{{MXUPDATE_MAPPING_FILE}}}* could be defined. The value is the path of the file which defines the additional properties. E.g.
{{{
set env MXUPDATE_MAPPING_FILE C:\project\MyProjectSettings.properties
}}}
Run MQL script *{{{MxInstall.mql}}}*.
{{{
run C:\project\MxUpdate\MxInstall.mql
}}}
Then the !MxUpdate Update deployment tool is installed and all !MxUpdate JPOs are compiled. The tool could be tested:
{{{
exec prog MxUpdate --help
}}}
The short help for all parameters of !MxUpdate is shown.

== Alternatives to Manually Downloads ==

=== Using SVN External Link ===
Instead of manually downloading the !MxUpdate Update deployment tool, an external link could be defined if [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] is used. E.g. following property entry "{{{svn:externals}}}" for a directory must be defined to reference version 0.3.0:
{{{
source http://mxupdate.googlecode.com/svn/mxupdate-update/tags/V0.3.0
}}}
Also this directory could hold the project specific MQL update script which installs the !MxUpdate Update deployment tool.

== Support of old MX versions ==

=== Relationship as from / to side for Relationships ===
If the used MX version within the project does not support the feature to use also relationships as from / to side the property "DMRelationSupportRelCons" must be changed and set to {{{false}}}. So following line must be added to the additional property file:
{{{
ParameterDef.DMRelationSupportRelCons.Default = false
}}}
The installed default value is {{{true}}}.

=== Role Types ===
If the used MX version within the project does not support the role type feature, property "!UserRoleSupportRoleType" must be changed and set to {{{false}}}. So following line must be added to the additional property file:
{{{
ParameterDef.UserRoleSupportRoleType.Default = false
}}}
The installed default value is {{{true}}}.
