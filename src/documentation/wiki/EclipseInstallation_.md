#Installation Overview of the MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In

---
##Overview
To install the !MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In correctly, following three steps must be done:
*   The [MX ADK](EclipseInstallation_ADK.md) must be first installed as Eclipse Plug-In.
*   Then the MxUpdate [Eclipse Plug-In](EclipseInstallation_PlugIn.md) could be installed from the MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In site http://mxupdate.googlecode.com/svn/mxupdate-eclipse-site/tags/ .
*   At least the [MxUpdate settings](EclipseInstallation_Connect.md) must be defined and the properties from MX loaded.]

The correct installation could be [checked](EclipseInstallation_Check.md) after Eclipse was restarted.
