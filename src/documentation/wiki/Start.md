##Introduction

The [MxUpdate](http://www.mxupdate.org) Tools is based on the [Configuration Item](CI_.md) philosophy. This means each administration object in MX is handled with a single update file.

To handle this philosophy the [MxUpdate](http://www.mxupdate.org) tool includes two different tools:
* MxUpdate Update Deployment Tool ([installation](UpdateInstallation.md), [usage](UpdateUsage.md))
* MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In ([installation](EclipseInstallation_.md), [usage](EclipseUsage.md))
