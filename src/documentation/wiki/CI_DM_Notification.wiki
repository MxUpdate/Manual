= Introduction =
The notification objects are used from the generic email utility to define the
subject, text and recipients of notifications (emails). The generic email
utility is described in the "Business Process Services Administrator's Guide"
(Live Collaboration Admin).

The notification object itself is internally stored in MX as business object
from type "Notification" with policy "Business Rule" in vault
"eService Administration".
