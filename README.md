#Introduction

The [MxUpdate](http://www.mxupdate.org) Tools is based on the [Configuration Item](chapter-4-ci/README.md) philosophy. This means each administration object in MX is handled with a single update file.

To handle this philosophy the [MxUpdate](http://www.mxupdate.org) tool includes the MxUpdate Update Deployment Tool ([installation](chapter-1-installation/README.md), [usage](chapter-3-usage/README.md)).
