#summary Describes how to develop MxUpdate Update development tool

= Install Eclipse Project =

  * In Eclipse create a new SVN project using the {{{trunc}}} directory.
  * Copy {{{eMatrixServletRMI.jar}}} directly into the new created project directory.
  * Add this Jar library to the build path.
  * Define the downloaded {{{src}}} directory as Java source folder.

The Jar file must be copied to defined place. Otherwise the ant task to create the Javadoc could not access the {{{eMatrixServletRMI.jar}}} jar library.

= Upload new Version to Google Code Downloads =
The ant target "upload" is defined to upload a new !MxUpdate version to the downloads at the !MxUpdate Google Code page. To use this ant task the two property entries
{{{
gc.username = tim@.....net
gc.password = XXXXXXXX
}}}
must be defined in the {{{build.properties}}} file .
