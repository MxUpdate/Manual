|| *Error Code* || *Description* ||
|| 10901        || A wrong parameter was given the the called TCL procedure {{{testParents}}} which defines the derived interfaces. ||
|| 10902        || The name of the interface which calls the TCL procedure {{{testParents}}} and which is defined within the call as parameter is not equal. ||
