= Introduction =
The eMatrixServletRMI.jar is required as a Eclipse Plug-In for the [Eclipse_Start MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In]. Because of the legal the Plug-In could not be made available from the [http://www.mxupdate.org MxUpdate] Team.

The Plug-In is only a "repacked" Eclipse plug-in from the original delivered eMatrixServletRMI.jar of Enovia PLM. The Jar-Library includes the Java-ADK for the MX database.
