The [http://www.mxupdate.org MxUpdate] Tools is based on the [CI Configuration Item] philosophy. This means each administration object in MX is handled with a single update file.

To handle this philosophy the [http://www.mxupdate.org MxUpdate] tool includes two different tools:
 * !MxUpdate Update Deployment Tool ([UpdateInstallation installation], [UpdateUsage usage])
 * !MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In ([Eclipse_Install installation])
