#summary Describes the special handling of administration persons as configuration item.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3"/>

= Introduction =
Administration Persons are persons in MX for which no related business
object exists (unlike [CI_User_Person "standard" persons]). Good examples for
such persons are the already standard installed "guest" and "creator" account.
If the related person business object does not exists an user could not login
into the web application. This means that such persons typically used only for
administration.

----

= Comments of Persons =
Internally comments of persons are handled in the same way as descriptions of
other administration objects. Further the MQL keyword {{{description}}} works
also for person. To be near to other administration objects MxUpdate uses for
persons also {{{description}}} instead of {{{comment}}}.

= Parameter Definitions =
