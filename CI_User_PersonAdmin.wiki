#summary Describes the special handling of administration persons as configuration item.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3"/>

= Introduction =
Administration Persons are persons in MX for which no related business
object exists (unlike [CI_User_Person "standard" persons]). Good examples for
such persons are the already standard installed "guest" and "creator" account.
If the related person business object does not exists an user could not login
into the web application. This means that such persons typically used only for
administration.

----

= Comments of Persons =
Internally comments of persons are handled in the same way as descriptions of
other administration objects. Further the MQL keyword {{{description}}} works
also for person. To be near to other administration objects MxUpdate uses for
persons also {{{description}}} instead of {{{comment}}}.

----

= Steps of the Update Flow =
Following steps are done before the TCL update file is executed:
  * all access on business objects are removed
  * all access on business administration objects are removed
  * comment / description, fax number, phone number, email address, address and full name is reset (to a zero length string)
  * all assigned roles / groups are removed
  * person is set to not hidden
  * assigned default application is removed
  * assigned site is removed
  * person specific workspace objects are deleted (depends on the parameters *UserIgnoreWSO4Persons* and *UserIgnoreWS4Users*)
  * password of the person expires (depends on the parameter *!UserPersonIgnorePswdNeverExpires*)
  * disables that the person wants email (depends on the parameter *!UserPersonIgnoreWantsEmail*)
  * enables that the person wants icon mail (depends on the parameter *!UserPersonIgnoreWantsIconMail*)
