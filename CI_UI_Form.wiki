#summary Describes the special handling of Web Forms as configuration item.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3"/>

----

= Handled Form Properties =
This form properties could be handled from !MxUpdate:
  * description
  * hidden flag
  * fields

----

= Steps of the Update Flow =
== Cleanup ==
Following steps are done before the TCL update file is executed:
  * The description is set to an empty string.
  * The form is set to not hidden.
  * All fields of the web form are removed.

== Update ==
The description is updated and all fields are new created and appended.

== Correct Order of Fiels ==
Because there is an issue in MX of correct order for new created and appended
fields (after all fields was removed), !MxUpdate specific TCL procedure
{{{orderFields}}} must be called. This TCL procedure orders all fields
correctly (by reordering them via MQL statements).

== Update ==
The TCL update file is executed.

----

= Parameter Definitions =
No further parameters are defined.
