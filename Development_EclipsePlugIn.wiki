#summary Describes how to develop MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In

<wiki:toc max_depth="3"/>

----

= Install Eclipse Project =
Prerequisites is that the Maven settings are already defined (as described in
[Development]).

  * In Eclipse create a new SVN project using the {{{trunc}}} directory.

The Maven dependencies are updated and the {{{eMatrixServletRMI.jar}}} and
{{{FcsClient.jar}}} are added (which should be checked).

----

= Result of an Maven Build =
After the install of a maven build is done, two jar files are located in the
target directory. The first one in the format
{{{
    org.mxupdate.eclipse_[VERSION].jar
}}}
is the Eclipse Plug-In itself, the second one in the format
{{{
    org.mxupdate.eclipse_[VERSION]-feature.jar
}}}
holds the {{{feature.xml}}}Â file needed for the site.
