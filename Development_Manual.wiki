= Create !MxUpdate Manual =
For the PDF manual of !MxUpdate the own sub project "mxupdate-manual" exists.


Two different profiles exists which could be activated:
|| *Name of the Profile* || *Description* ||
|| {{{make-pdf}}}        || Prepares the manual as PDF file. ||
|| {{{release-profile}}} || The PDF document is uploaded to Google Code. ||
The two profiles exists because the {{{gcupload}}} plug-in does currently not
work together with the {{{eFaps Wiki plug-in}}} (which is used to create the
PDF manual).

== Generate PDF File ==
{{{
mvn clean wikiutil:convert2pdf -P make-pdf
}}}

== Upload to Google Code ==
The (not existing) source code is tried to pack, but ignored for the upload.
Only the created PDF file is uploaded.
{{{
mvn gcupload:gcupload -P release-profile
}}}
