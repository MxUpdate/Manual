The !MxUpdate Console is automatically opened and shows a successful connect:

== Restart Eclipse ==
Because the !MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In always loads the current configuration from the installed !MxUpdate Update Deployment tool, Eclipse must be restarted. A restart is always needed if the configuration of !MxUpdate Update Deployment tool is changed (in this case a message is shown to the user in the console).

After Eclipse is restarted a connected again following message should be shown in the console:

= Connection Settings =

== Host ==
The Host defines the URL to the MX server.
  * If no value is entered, the MX ADK loads the shared library of the kernel directly in the same Java VM of Eclipse.
  * If the URL of the host starts with {{{http}}} or {{{https}}} then the !MxUpdate Eclipse Plug-In connects to the MX web application server. The root directory of the deployed application must be entered.
  * Also a RMI server could be defined. Then the URL must start with {{{rmi}}}.
For for information see also the ADK documentation of Enovia PLM.

== User Name ==
The name of a user must be entered. The user *must* have business administration access! After first installation e.g. the user "creator" have this access.

== Password ==
The password of the defined user must be specified. If the user has no password, no value must be entered.

== Flag "..done by transmitting File Content" ==
If you are connection to MX on another computer, e.g. inside a virtual machine, then you could select the flag "Update is done by transmitting File Content". This means that the content of an update file is also transmitted to the server.  The server writes the file content to temporary files and runs the update.

The flag must not selected if the MX application server (defined by the host) could reach the update files with the same path. Especially if no host is host is defined and the MX kernel runs directly in the Java VM of Eclipse.
